"""
Tesseract OCR Driver Module.

This module provides an implementation of the Captcha driver using Tesseract OCR.
The Tesseract driver utilizes Tesseract OCR to extract text from captcha images.

Note:
    This driver requires the pytesseract library and Tesseract OCR to be installed.

Classes:

    For this driver, the whitelist includes uppercase and lowercase alphabets (A-Z, a-z) and digits (0-9).

            expressions to remove non-alphanumeric characters.
